## About The Project

This website is here to support the Chinese American Heritage in Idaho Teaching Trunk. You’ll find links to extra resources, a gallery of cool images, historical tidbits, and downloadable forms from the Chinese American Heritage in Idaho teaching trunk to make your experience even smoother. 

The whole purpose of this project is to educate people about Chinese Americans in Idaho and the rich history of Chinese communities in the state. From the early days of mining and railroad work to the vibrant contributions of Chinese Americans today, this trunk is all about sharing stories that often go untold. 

These trunks are the product of a collaborative effort between the University of Idaho and the [Asian American Comparative Collection](https://www.uidaho.edu/class/anthrolab/collections/aacc), with incredible support from educators and Chinese American community members throughout the state.  

Right now, there are two teaching trunks ready to be checked out--one in Moscow, Idaho, at the Asian American Comparative Collection, and another in Boise at the Idaho State Historical Society. These trunks are packed with 16 unique lessons covering everything from archaeology and Chinese American history to work life, community life, family life, and even the incredible accomplishments of present-day Chinese American communities. 

But it’s not just about reading and learning--these trunks are all about doing! Students can get hands-on with historic artifacts, try their hand at mock gold panning, practice calligraphy, explore historic buildings in Idaho, and even interact with a GIS map. This website has even more activities for students. From crossword puzzles and printable jigsaw puzzles to coloring pages and driving tours of historic sites across the state. 

Please enjoy this website and thank you for using our teaching trunks.
